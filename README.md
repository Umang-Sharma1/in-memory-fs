# In-Memory File System ## Overview This project implements an in-memory file system that supports various file operations such as creating directories, navigating through directories, and performing file operations like create, move, copy, and delete. The system includes a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for executing these operations. ## Features - **mkdir**: Create a new directory. - **cd**: Change the current directory. - **ls**: List the contents of the current or specified directory. - **touch**: Create a new empty file. - **echo**: Write text to a file. - **cat**: Display the contents of a file. - **mv**: Move a file or directory to another location. - **cp**: Copy a file or directory to another location. - **rm**: Remove a file or directory. - **help**: Display a list of available commands and their usage. - **exit**: Exit the file system. ## Requirements - Node.js - TypeScript ## Installation 1. Clone the repository: ```sh git clone https://github.com/Umang-Sharma1/in-memory-fs.git cd in-memory-fs ``` 2. Install dependencies: ```sh npm install ``` 3. Compile TypeScript files: ```sh npm run build ``` 4. Start the in-memory file system: ```sh npm start ``` ## Usage Once the file system is started, you can use the following commands: - **mkdir**: Create a new directory. ```sh mkdir [directory_name] ``` Example: ```sh mkdir mydir ``` - **cd**: Change the current directory. ```sh cd [directory_path] ``` Example: ```sh cd mydir cd .. cd / ``` - **ls**: List the contents of the current or specified directory. ```sh ls [optional_directory_path] ``` Example: ```sh ls ls mydir ``` - **touch**: Create a new empty file. ```sh touch [file_name] ``` Example: ```sh touch myfile.txt ``` - **echo**: Write text to a file. ```sh echo [text...] [file_name] ``` Example: ```sh echo "Hello World" myfile.txt ``` - **cat**: Display the contents of a file. ```sh cat [file_name] ``` Example: ```sh cat myfile.txt ``` - **mv**: Move a file or directory to another location. ```sh mv [source_path] [destination_path] ``` Example: ```sh mv myfile.txt newdir/myfile.txt ``` - **cp**: Copy a file or directory to another location. ```sh cp [source_path] [destination_path] ``` Example: ```sh cp myfile.txt newdir/myfile.txt ``` - **rm**: Remove a file or directory. ```sh rm [target_path] ``` Example: ```sh rm myfile.txt ``` - **help**: Display a list of available commands and their usage. ```sh help ``` - **exit**: Exit the file system. ```sh exit ``` ## Testing Run the the tests using Jest:```shnpm test
